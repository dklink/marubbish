function collision_rate = get_algae_collisions (particle, S, T, chl, I)% get_algae_collisions: calculates rate of algae/particle collisions. Kooi 2017, eq. 11, first term% % particle: the particle we're calculating for% S: salinity at the particle (g kg^-1)% T: temperature at the particle (Celsius)% chl: the ambient chlorophyll-a concentration at the particle (mg m^-3)% I: light intensity at the particle (mol quanta m^-2 s^-1)% return: rate of algae/particle collisions (# algal cells s^-1)            Beta_A = get_encounter_kernel_rate(particle, S, T);        A_A = convert_chl_to_algae(chl, T, I);  % ambient algae concentration (# algae cells m^-3)        collision_rate = Beta_A * A_A;  % (# algae cells s^-1)end% note: we do not divide by theta_pl as Kooi does, because we are working% with algal cell count, while she works with algae cell concentration on% plastic surface (algae cell count m^-2)
